# NeoTouch: Touchless AI Interaction System

**NeoTouch** is an AI-powered, computer vision-based interface that allows you to control your entire desktop **without touching** your keyboard or mouse. Using only **hand gestures and facial movements**, you can navigate, click, scroll, and zoom 

## 🔥 Features

- ✅ **Touchless Cursor Control** – Move the mouse with your index finger.
- ✅ **Pinch to Click** – Simply pinch your thumb and index finger together to perform a click.
- ✅ **Scroll with Two Fingers** – Use index and middle fingers to scroll content up or down.
- ✅ **Smart Zoom with Face Proximity** – Zoom in when your face moves closer to the screen and auto-reset when you lean back.
- 🚫 No hardware gloves or sensors required – only a webcam.

## 🧠 How It Works

NeoTouch uses:
- **MediaPipe** for real-time hand and face tracking.
- **OpenCV** to process webcam input.
- **PyAutoGUI** for controlling the OS GUI based on interpreted gestures.
- **NumPy & Math** to calculate hand distances and facial positions.
